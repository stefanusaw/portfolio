    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <div class="problem-container">

      <p><b>Problem 1: </b>As a frequent Spotify user, I’ve noticed that <b><em>incorrect song credits</em></b> can lead
        to a frustrating experience,
        especially when it affects song recommendations. For example, inaccurate credits distort the algorithm’s ability
        to generate relevant playlists like Release Radar, leading to less accurate song suggestions. This not only
        undermines the quality of personalized recommendations but also diminishes the overall music discovery
        experience.
        These errors in song credits can create a ripple effect on listening habits, and it's important to address this
        to
        ensure users get the most out of Spotify’s features.
      </p>
      <p><b>Problem 2: </b> During a road trip, I found myself using my friend's Apple Music and was impressed by how
        easily I could add songs to the queue. Apple Music's "Play Next" and "Play Last" options gave me much more
        flexibility compared to Spotify's simpler "Add to Queue" feature. It got me thinking—how much better would the
        experience be if Spotify combined these features, offering users the freedom to manage their queue exactly how
        they want?
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fix Song Credit Errors:</b> Make it easy for users to report incorrect song credits to improve the accuracy
        of song recommendations and playlists.</li>
      <li><b>Enhance Queue Control:</b> Integrate Apple Music's "Play Next" and "Play Last" features to give users more
        flexibility in managing their queue.</li>
      <li><b>Ensure Seamless Integration:</b> Ensure these features integrate naturally into the Spotify experience,
        without disrupting the music flow.</li>
      <li><b>Improve User Engagement:</b> Make Spotify more enjoyable and personalized, encouraging users to interact
        with the platform more frequently.</li>
    </ul>

    </iframe>


    <h3>Key Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Song Credit Reporting Feature:</b> Introduced an easy-to-use reporting form for users to flag incorrect
        song credits, improving the accuracy of song recommendations and playlists.</li>
      <li><b>Queue Flexibility (Play Next & Play Last):</b> Combined Apple Music's "Play Next" and "Play Last" features
        into Spotify, allowing users to have more control over their song queue.</li>
      <li><b>Seamless User Flow:</b> Ensured both features were integrated smoothly into Spotify's interface, providing
        a seamless and intuitive experience without disrupting the user's music enjoyment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Further Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potential abuse of the song credit reporting feature. Users could report correct credits as
        errors, which may lead to unnecessary reviews and delays in processing legitimate issues.</li>
      <li>The "Play Next", "Play Last", and "Add to Queue" options may not be intuitive for all users,
        especially those who are new to Spotify or unfamiliar with advanced queue management.</li>
      <li>Limited feedback mechanism. Users may not always be aware of the outcome of their report
        submissions, which can result in frustration or disengagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhancing the reporting feature with clearer guidelines and examples to prevent
        misuse and to ensure that only valid credit issues are reported.</li>
      <li>Improving the visibility of the song queue features by providing tooltips or an
        onboarding tutorial for first-time users to guide them through the options and their functionalities.</li>
      <li>Integrating better notification systems for users who report song credits, so
        they receive updates on the status of their submission, improving transparency and trust in the process.</li>
    </ul>
